Our team, a software development company, has been approached by a client with an idea to develop a social media platform tailored for fitness enthusiasts to share their fitness journey, workouts, and healthy lifestyle tips. The refined concept proposed by the client is as follows:

Media Sharing:

Users can post pictures and videos showcasing their fitness activities, workouts, healthy meals, and progress.
Allow users to upload up to 3 photos or videos (max length: 30 seconds) directly from their devices.
Provide options for users to add descriptions to accompany their media posts.

Workout Updates:

Users can create and share updates on their current workout status, including metrics like distance ran, number of pushups completed, weight lifted, etc.
Predefined templates make it easy for users to input their workout metrics and share their progress.
Each post should include a brief description of the fitness achievement provided by the user.

Workout Plan Sharing:

Users can share their workout plans, including routines, exercises, sets, and repetitions.
Provide customizable templates for users to create and modify their workout plans within the platform.
Enable users to update their workout plans as their fitness goals and preferences evolve.

Meal Plan Sharing:

Users can share their meal plans, including recipes, nutritional information, and portion sizes.
Tools are available for users to create and document their meal plans, with options for adding ingredients, cooking instructions, and photos of prepared meals.
Implement features for users to categorize their meal plans based on dietary preferences, such as vegetarian, vegan, keto, etc.
